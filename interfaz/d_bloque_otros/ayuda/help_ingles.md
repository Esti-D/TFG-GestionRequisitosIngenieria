### Load documents to the Database
1. Using the **Select file** button (opens the file explorer), choose the PDF file with requirements. It will appear in the viewer window. Then, start the process by pressing the **LOAD** button. A window will open to select the project to which you want to add the requirements.
2. Once the project is selected, click accept to proceed. The upload process completes, showing the content and allowing you to edit (to correct or delete if needed).
3. The system will analyze potential subsystems impact and suggest relevant subsystems. You can select one or all of them as needed.
   
Upon completion, the requirements/document will be stored and linked to the selected project and subsystems.

### Queries
1. You can search for requirements, documents, projects, and subsystems by marking the desired option.
2. To list all items, simply press the **Query** button.
3. To make a specific selection, use the **Documents**, **Projects**, and **Subsystems** filters. You can apply a single filter or combine them; for example, to select the documents of a specific project and a particular subsystem.

### Other Options
1. **Projects**: You can add new projects to the database to assign documents and requirements to them. The recommended criterion is to use the city name where the project will take place. You can also delete projects.
2. **Subsystems**: You can add new subsystems to the database. To ensure a subsystem is recognized in a document/requirement scope analysis, it is necessary to include its keywords in the associated `TOKENES.csv` file. You can also delete subsystems.
3. **Assign**: This option allows you to create relationships between documents and subsystems after loading the document. It is designed for cases where you need to associate a document with another subsystem afterward. You can also delete associations.
